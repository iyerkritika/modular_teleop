# modular_teleop
This is a framework which will make tele-operation between ABB IRB120 and geomagic touch possible along with force feedback. This can be useful as a proof of concept for bigger projects that make a generalized framework. This project used Openhaptics software to introduce force feedback from the geo-magic touch. The implementation of this has been done in Gazebo using ROS and visualized in Rviz.

This project is being continued and hardware implementation is being done using PMD controllers.
