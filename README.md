# modular_teleop
This is a framework which will make tele-operation between ABB IRB120 and geomagic touch possible along with force feedback. This can be useful as a proof of concept for bigger projects that make a generalized framework. This project used Openhaptics software to introduce force feedback from the geo-magic touch. The implementation of this has been done in Gazebo using ROS and visualized in Rviz.
